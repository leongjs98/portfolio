from torrenting.

Welcome friends, in this post, I am going to teach you the 
dark art of torrenting to beginners. 

Whether you are using this knowledge to torrent legitimate
stuff online or not is completely up to you.

## How
First, you will need a torrenting client, just [download 
Tranmission](https://transmissionbt.com/download). Don't 
even bother with other clients if you are just starting out.

After you download Transmission, let's say you want to 
torrent something **totally legit** like an iso of Arch 
Linux. First, you would need a magnet link of the iso file. 
You can go to the 
[official Arch Linux website](https://archlinux.org/download/) 
and look for a magnet icon.

Or if you are like me and would like your magnet link on 
sites like piratebay, you can also head to piratebay or 
similar site, search "Arch Linux". Right click on the 
magnet and hit "Copy Image Link" or "Copy Link Address".

Open Transmission, click File, then open URL, if you 
already copied the link, the link will be pasted in. If 
not, just go ahead and copy the link in again.

## Giving Back
The file you torrented came from some other people. And 
they seeded (share) with you so you can have it. Always 
remember to seed after feed.

A good courtesy is to seed at least 1.0 ratio of what you 
torrented, that way you make sure at least 1 other person 
has it. If you are generous, do seed for more!

## Nerd Stuff
Torrenting is quite an interesting technology. Rather than
downloading a file from a single source (e.g. website), you
are getting the file from seeder(s). And if there are more
seeders, your download would generally be faster.

For anyone that's not tech savvy and is not interested in 
the nerdy stuff. Just think of torrenting as downloading,
and seed the torrent after downloading for others.

## Risk
There are some risks from torrenting:
1. If you are downloading copyrighted contents, you run the 
risk of getting DMCA letters.
2. People can see your public IP address and could DDOS you.

You can get more details just by searching.

### Minimizing Risk
One of the most common ways is to change your IP address. 
And arguably the easiest way to change it is via VPN. You
can use whatever VPN out there (do try to avoid the free
ones tho).

If you want to use a paid one, you can use [my Surfshark 
VPN link](https://surfshark.club/friend/szFAuUXj). If you
use my link and stay with Surfshark for more than 1 month,
you and I both get 1 month of free VPN. Yay!

Or you can just get any other VPNs out there. Just go on
YouTube and you will find others shilling for them 
shamelessly (like me).
